    <h2>Title</h2>

  <h4> Number 5: Orange</h4>
  <p>A fun color that has a good fruit named after it. Great base color that goes well with many accents</p>
  
  <h4> Number 4: Black</h4>
  <p>The best neutral color out there. Black is an amazing color thats great to put anywhere. Also half of the wonderful monochrome pallet.</p>
  
  <h4> Number 3: Pink</h4>
  <p>The best of the warm colors, probably biased from my wardrobe, but I think it looks good on me.</p>
  
  <h4> Number 2: Green</h4>
   <p>I have heard that the human eye can see the most green shades out of any color, and it makes sense. Plenty of amazing shades to this wonderful color</p>

  <h4> Number 1: Purple</h4>
  <p>The Royal color. A cool color, and the winner. It screams style.</p>
